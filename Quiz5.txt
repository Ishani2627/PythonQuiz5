#after applying parenthesis() for every print statement

Que1
Ans = 24
x = 2*2, x = 4*3, x = 12*2

Que2
Ans = 2.0
floor division, gives the quotient only and decimal value because value of a is in decimal

Que3
Ans = ACADVIEW
it is because - for "and", both the conditions should be true
              - for "or" , any one condition should be true
            
Que4
Ans = 3
not a = false, not b = true
false or true or true and true, only this can execute

Que5
Ans = 4
because count is initialised by 1, it will 2 then 3 and finally 4 (if it was initialised by 0 then answer would be 3)

Que6
Ans = 111
when parameter for the class is passed, the id value would be overwritten

Que7
Ans = 0
      1
      4
      5
index starts from 0 if not mentioned, first loop will print two values "0 and 1"
indexing will start from 4, and last index is not considered, loop ends at index-1, so second loop prints "4 and 5"

Que8
Ans = 1
      2
      3
      4
values contains 4 elements [1,2,34]

Que9
Ans = 3
as 3 parameters are passed 

Que10
51
manager.life is 49
length of manager.__dict__(49) is 2
49+2 = 51

Que11
Ans = it will give an error as string and integer, it cannot convert integer to string implicitly
after putting 13 in quotes as "13", these can be concatenated
and result would be "AcadView13"

Que12
Ans = 4
1+2+1 = 4

Que13
Ans = 2
initially, length was 3, 1st element is deleted and new element is added at its place, length remains 3, 2nd element is deleted but not added
so length of the dictionary is 2

Que14
Ans = k
as indexing of the list starts from 0, so at index it is "pratik", and from that indexing starts from the last as -1, 
so last element of the first index is "k"

Que15
Ans = error
ACADVIEW is not in the list so it will give an error
if element would have been in the list, it had multiplied the index by 5 and then given the result

Que16
Ans = 5
4 elements are already present in the list, when list is appended, its adds one element to the list, [5,6,7,8] this is one element
that is added to the list, so total elements in the list are "5"

Que17
Ans = 5
one element is already there, and four elements are present in mylistContainer

Que18
Ans = webs
it also counts the blank spaces, so index starts from 17 and print the elements till 20

Que19
Ans = 1 1 1
      1 2 1
      3 2 3
for 1st print statement, value of "val = 1" in every case
then B.val = 2, and other two are still the same
then A.val = 3, B.val = 2 and then C(A) will be 3
so the result is as written above

Que20
Ans = 12
first if statement will be executed 2 times, therefore, count = 2
second if statement will be executed 1 time, count = 2+10 = 12

Que21
Ans = [0, 1]
      [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 4]
      [0, 1, 0, 1, 4]
as the function is called and parameters are given, it will be executed accordingly
